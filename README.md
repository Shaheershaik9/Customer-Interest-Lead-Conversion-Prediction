# Customer Interest & Lead Conversion Prediction


# Project Description: 

Understanding customer patterns is one of the important activities in every business, based on customer pattern and customer status our next step was majorly planned in every business process.

# Data Description:

Customer Name: Unique identifier for each customer.
Location: Customer's geographic location (city, state, country).
Status: Indicates whether the lead converted to a customer (Yes/No).
Description: Textual data containing the conversation between the customer and the business executive.
Business Executive Name: Name of the executive who interacted with the customer.

# Solution Approach :

This outlines a basic approach to analyze customer data and identify factors impacting conversion rates:

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Use Python libraries like pandas to load and clean the customer data.
Address missing values (e.g., impute or remove rows) and handle inconsistencies.
Encode categorical features like location e.g., one-hot encoding.

2. Sentiment Analysis:

Leverage libraries like TextBlob to analyze the sentiment positive, negative, neutral of customer conversations within the "Description" field.
This provides a basic understanding of customer satisfaction during interactions.

3. Keyword Extraction:

Identify relevant keywords that might indicate customer interest or concerns.
Tools like NLTK can help extract keywords like "pricing," "features," or competitor mentions.
Analyze how the presence of these keywords relates to conversion rates.

4. Customer Segmentation:

Group customers based on location or basic inferred demographics from location data.
This allows for comparing conversion rates across different customer segments.

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Use visualization libraries like matplotlib and seaborn:
Plot conversion rates by customer segment to identify potential location-based patterns.
Visualize the distribution of sentiment scores across converted and non-converted leads.
Explore correlations between keyword presence and conversion probability.

6. Simple Predictive Model :

Consider building a basic Logistic Regression model:
Use features like sentiment score, presence of key keywords, and dummy variables for location segments.
Train the model to predict lead conversion based on these features.
While a simple model might not achieve high accuracy, it can provide initial insights into conversion-influencing factors.

# Result
Gain valuable customer insights from text data.
Improve lead conversion rates.
Optimize business processes for better customer acquisition.
